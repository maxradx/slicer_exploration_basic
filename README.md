# slicer_exploration_basic
Basic examples of customization capabilities in 3DSlicer in order to perform 
semi-automated/manual correction segmentation more efficiently on medical 
images for research purposes.

## Requirements
1. Slicer working [Download 3D slicer](https://download.slicer.org). E.g 5.2.2
2. Enable developer mode (Edit > Application Settings > Developer > 
Check Enable developer mode and QT testing. Restart Slicer.
3. Clone (or download) this repository.

## How to set variables
1. Go in src/navigation.py file and follow configuration at the top of the file.
2. Once configuration completed, copy in clipboard all the code in navigation.py
3. Open 3DSlicer app
4. Paste the code you've just copied in 2 into the Slicer python console or 
   paste the following command in the Slicer python console : exec(open
   ("ABSOLUTE PATH OF navigation.py").read())
   Example : exec(open("/Users/maximebouthillier/gitmax/code/myrepos/slicer_exploration_basic/src/navigation.py").read())
5. Repeat steps 1 to 4 and replace scr/navigation.py by src/writing.py 
   (script 2)


## Important Notes
1. Latest versions of 3DSlicer may have some problems for running properly. For 
   example, after having installed SlicerJupyter on Slicer version 5.6.2, 
   the 3DSlicer app crashed each time at opening (this has been solved by 
   installing an older version of slicer such as version 5.2.2).


2. Make sure to have no folder(s) and/or file(s) starting with a number in 
   their name since it may cause troubleshooting while running python 
   scripts.  Never put one or more space in the title of a folder and/or a 
   name  (you can do underscore instead _.  Example of an appropriate 
   pathname: /Users/maximebouthillier/gitmax/code/jacques/ICH_SEGMENTER_V2/moncode/readme.txt).


4. Double check that the paths in your 3DSlicer application are functionals 
   since you may experience troubleshooting if not. You may find a testing  
   script [here](../resources/SlicerWithExtensions.sh)


5. Before running navigation.py, make sur you do not have hidden file such 
   as .DS_Store. You can verify it by opening a terminal in your data 
   directory and excute the following command: ls -al 


6. Those examples provided have been executed on :
- MacOS 14.4.1 Sonoma on M2 Apple Silicon Valley Chip;
- 3DSlicer version 5.2.2


## Examples provided 
Each example could be further improved according to users' wishes.
1. Navigate (next/previous) trough images loaded from a data folder and 
opening the last viewed image at 3DSlicer restart. 
To note that a PushButton can be configured to load the last seen images: here, 
we show an automated method to open the last volume loaded in 3DSlicer at next 
startup (in the script, it is possible to adapt the new loaded volume at startup 
to be the next volume to be loaded);

Demonstration video of example 1 can be found [here](../resources/example1slicer.mov).

2. Write in an external file from clicking a GUI push button in 3DSlicer.

Demonstration video of example 2 can be found [here](../resources/example2slicer.mov).


## Analysis
Resum√© of some explorations performed on 3DSlicer platform : is it worth to use
as a software for massive segmentations in different datasets 
(instead of fsleyes for instance)?
Advantages: 
- Customizable GUI;
- Capabilities for running python scripts and easily manage them;
- More user friendly for annotation and customization than fsleyes;
- Multiple extensions easily accessibles;
- Lot of development and possibility including MONAI tools.

Limitations:
- Uses an integrated version of Qt to Slicer, which makes debugging difficult 
(open-source version of Qt is not well supported);
- Installation can be a mess, especially because of redirecting paths;
- Most recent (e.g 5.6.2) versions do not fully support useful extensions (e.g. 
  SlicerJupyter).

With the aims of performing segmentation accurately and efficiently, it is 
useful from a user perspective to load the image(or the next one) that the user
was on lastly before re-opening the app used for segmentation. 3DSlicer offers
the possibility to run an automated python script at startup. Related to the 
SCT-manual_correction script developed by Neuropoly, it seems very realistic 
to incorporate and execute such a script in the 3DSlicer environment, that 
would enable iteration across cases after completing segmentation for a given 
volume. In brief, 3DSlicer may be useful for massive segmentations of 
datasets since it allows creation/customization of 
GUI/Software preprocessing/iteration trough cases while minimizing user 
interaction.
